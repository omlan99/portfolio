    <h2 className="text-6xl font-medium text-center py-12">About Me</h2>
    <p className="text-xl  ">I am a Junior MERN stack developer with a deep passion for coding and problem-solving. My journey started with curiosity, exploring different technologies and pushing beyond traditional learning paths. Over time, I honed my skills in both frontend and backend development, aspiring to become a full-stack developer who can build seamless, efficient, and impactful web solutions.
      <br />
I thrive on solving challenges, breaking down complex problems, and continuously learning new technologies. Whether it’s crafting engaging user interfaces or designing robust backend systems, I enjoy the process of bringing ideas to life through code.
<br />
Beyond programming, I have a love for music and reading books, which fuel my creativity and analytical thinking. I see coding not just as a skill but as a way to think, create, and innovate—driven by curiosity and the endless possibilities technology offers.</p>
