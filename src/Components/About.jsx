        <span className="font-semibold"> Coding Journey</span> :
        I am a Junior MERN stack developer with a deep passion for coding and
        problem-solving. My journey started with curiosity, exploring different
        technologies and pushing beyond traditional learning paths. Over time, I
        honed my skills in both frontend and backend development, aspiring to
        become a full-stack developer who can build seamless, efficient, and
        impactful web solutions.

      <span className="font-semibold">Other then coding</span> :
        I thrive on solving challenges, breaking down complex problems, and
        continuously learning new technologies. Whether it’s crafting engaging
        user interfaces or designing robust backend systems, I enjoy the process
        of bringing ideas to life through code.
      </p>

      <p className="text-xl">
        Beyond programming, I have a love for music and reading books, which
        fuel my creativity and analytical thinking. I see coding not just as a
        skill but as a way to think, create, and innovate—driven by curiosity
        and the endless possibilities technology offers.
